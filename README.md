# A basic character planner for Path of Achra
Achra Builder was built with the intention of being a simple, easy-to-use character planner for Ulfsire's Path of Achra, and it provides a quick way to share builds via plaintext export (or JSON if you so desire).
This is meant as a basic and barebones character planner, bereft of excessive features such as player inventory/equipment slots and detailed breakdowns of what each individual stat does and how the skills affect. (the wiki serves this purpose better, and Achra Builder is
meant to be used in tandem with such info on hand), so this can be moreso viewed as a way to transform the character planning process into a more visual process, and not a tool that completely supplants any other.

# Installation
**You must provide the program with your own JSON files and place them in the tables directory**. This can be done by unpacking the game using Godot decompilation tools such as [gdsdecomp](https://github.com/bruvzg/gdsdecomp).
To install, download the archive that corresponds to your OS of choice from the releases page, extract, and add your JSON files - it's as simple as that.]
